# CHATBOT

This code defines a dictionary called OPERATORS that maps the user's input to the corresponding operator function from the operator module. The calculate function prompts the user to input two numbers and the operation they would like to perform, then uses the dictionary to look up the appropriate operator function and perform the calculation. If the user would like to perform more operations, the function will loop back to the beginning and ask for new inputs. If the user enters an invalid input, the function will display an error message and ask for new input.
